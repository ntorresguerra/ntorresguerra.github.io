<h1 style="color:white;text-align:center;">Regardless of your reason for happiness/sadness, life goes on.</h1>
<p style="color:white;text-align:center;">Time has progressed forward.</p>

<p style="color:white;text-align:center;">In a visit to the hospital for an annual checkup, a revelation has been made to you.<br>
In a shocking turn of events, you are told that you will die to unexplainable reasons.<br>
Doctors have no idea what to do with you.<br>Treatments may prolong your life for a few more days.<br>But the pain of feeling like a lab rat keeps you second guessing.<br>
Your mind begins to wander, thinking about the short future that still has yet to be seen.<br>
Contemplating how your life has gone up to this point.<br>
But now you're upset.<br>How is this fair?<br>Why are you going to live such a short life?<br>Why be born if only to experience so little?<br>Such wasted potential.<br>
Reality sets in. The truth is, Death is the only fair thing in this world. We all must face it eventually.<br>
You begin to think about the present, and where you're at in life.<br>What will you do?</p> 

<p style="color:white;text-align:center;"><a href="mementomori11.html">Will your life change?</a></p>
