<h1 style="color:white;">Regardless of your reason for happiness/sadness, life goes on.</h1>
<p style="color:white;">Time has progressed forward.</p>

<p style="color:white;">In a visit to the hospital for an annual checkup, a revelation has been made to you.
In a shocking turn of events, you are told that you will die to unexplainable reasons.
Doctors have no idea what to do with you. Treatments may prolong your life for a few more days. But the pain of feeling like a lab rat keeps you second guessing.
Your mind begins to wander, thinking about the short future that still has yet to be seen.
Contemplating how your life has gone up to this point.
But now you're upset. How is this fair? Why are you going to live such a short life? Why be born if only to experience so little? Such wasted potential.
Reality sets in. The truth is, Death is the only fair thing in this world. We all must face it eventually.
You begin to think about the present, and where you're at in life. What will you do?</p> 

<p style="color:white;"><a href="mementomori11.html">Will your life change?</a></p>
