<h1 style="color:white;text-align:center;">You have decided to take a vacation and explore the world.</h1>
<p style="color:white;font-size:160%;text-align:center;">You wanted to experience most of what the world had to offer.</p>

<p style="color:white;font-size:160%;text-align:center;">There were many places to visit and sights to behold.<br>
Though you knew you couldn't seem them all in one go, you made sure to cross off the most desirable off your bucket list.<br>
No matter what, your decision was made in hopes that it would make your life much more complete.</p>
