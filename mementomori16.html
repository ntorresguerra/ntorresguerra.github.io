<body style="background-color:black;">

<h1 style="color:white;text-align:center;">You have decided to live with a different outlook on life.</h1>
<p style="color:white;font-size:160%;text-align:center;">No drastic life changes were made.</p>

<p style="color:white;font-size:160%;text-align:center;">Life was going good for the most part.<br>
Though dying so soon is quite the bummer, it did not prompt you to take any action that would result in regret.<br>
You feel as though you have a better understanding of how precious life is.</p>
